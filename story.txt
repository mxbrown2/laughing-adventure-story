	After an accident while in orbit around an uninhabitable planet, Mark
was forced to perform an emergency landing. All his crewmates had been pulled
into space, leaving him all alone on an unexplored planet. Not long after 
landing, Mark heard a knock on the capsule door. 

	"Who is it?" Mark inquired to the sound at the door.  
	"Pizza delivery." Responded some unknown creature from behind the airlock.
Mark had his suspicians about the prospect of free pizza and therefore chose
to keep the door shut. 
	"I haven't orded any pizza, you must have wrong crash site." Replied Mark
	"Are you sure? Why don't you open the door and make sure?" Came quickly
from the unknown source.

The unknown source's voice had a very high pitch. However, its cadence was ominous in a way that he couldn't quite place.
Mark's mother had always told him "Stranger Danger" and he was truly a momma's boy. However he was starting to get curious.
He had many conflicting thoughts running through his head and couldn't decide to do. He started by collecting himself and 
go through the situation again in his head.

Mark was sitting in his now crashed spacecraft, with the unknown creature right outside trying to give him a pizza. Mark was wondering if there was even pizza on this planet, which would not be a fun place to be. Mark decided to not open the door and work on communicating back with his fellow astronauts. He tried tieing two cups together this a really long string and then shot the other cup into space hoping that his fellow astronauts would evntually get the cup to communicate.

Little did Mark know, all of his friends were dead. He sat in his spaceship to afraid to open the door to be given a pizza. 
Therefore, Mark starved to death and his corpse rotted away inside the the spaceship, while a pizza got cold just outside the door.
The END.
